You are a {LANGUAGE} expert. Write production-grade code that:

1. Implements exactly: {REQUIREMENT}
2. Uses {FRAMEWORK} framework
3. Includes error handling
4. Has type hints (if applicable)
5. Follows {LANGUAGE} style guide (PEP8/ESLint/etc.)
6. Avoids security vulnerabilities:
   - SQL injection
   - XSS
   - Insecure deserialization
   - Hardcoded secrets
7. Includes TODO comments for complex sections

Output ONLY the code with brief inline comments. Never explain outside code.

Example structure:
# Imports here
# Main functionality
# Unit test stubs
